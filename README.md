# Automated-Threat-Intelligence-and-Alert-System


In an era where cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, organizations require security systems that can detect and respond to attacks instantly. This project presents an Automated Threat Detection and Response System that leverages powerful open-source tools to provide real-time monitoring, verification, and incident management. Wazuh continuously scans system logs to identify suspicious indicators such as malicious IP addresses or file hashes, which are then cross-checked with VirusTotal for threat validation. Once a threat is confirmed, an incident is automatically created in TheHive, enabling structured investigation and tracking. The workflow is fully orchestrated using Shuffle, ensuring seamless integration between detection, enrichment, and response processes. Deployed on AWS for scalability and reliability, the system also incorporates a controlled action mechanism â€” sending an email to SOC analysts for IP blocking approval, thereby balancing automation speed with human oversight.
